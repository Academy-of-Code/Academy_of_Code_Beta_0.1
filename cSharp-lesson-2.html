<h3>Lesson 2 -- Main Data Types</h3>

<p>The 8 main data types in C# is String, Bool, Char, Decimal, Double, Float, Long, Int. Now let's go into depth about these data types.<br> <br>String, a string is a way to store characters, sentences, or user input.<br><br>Bool or Boolean, is a way to store either a true or false value.<br><br>Char or Character, is a way to store a <strong>SINGE</strong> character for example, "t", "f","D".<br><br>Decimal, a decimal is a way to store decimal values but you would have to put 'm' as the suffix.<br><br>Double, a double is a way to store decimal values just like the decimal type but with no suffix.<br><br>Float, a float is a shorter way to store decimals, it requires no suffix and takes less decimal spaces.<br><br>Long, a long is a data type that is like an <u>int</u> but can hold longer numbers from: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 but they have to be whole numbers.<br><br>Int or Integer, is just like a long but holds numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647 and can only hold whole numbers.</p>
